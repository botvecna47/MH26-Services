# Registration & OTP Flow

This document explains how a new user joins the platform.

## 📝 The Steps

1.  **Sign Up Form**:
    - The user enters their Name, Email, Phone, and Password.
    - They choose if they are a "Customer" or "Provider".

2.  **Sending OTP**:
    - The server creates a random 6-digit code (OTP).
    - It sends this code to the user's email address.

3.  **Verification**:
    - The user enters the code on the website.
    - The server checks if it matches.
    - If it matches, the account is activated!

## 🔒 Why do we do this?
- To make sure the email address is real.
- To prevent spam accounts.
- To keep the platform safe for everyone.
