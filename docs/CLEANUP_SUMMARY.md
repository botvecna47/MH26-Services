# Project Cleanup Report

This document records the cleanup work we did to make the project better and more organized.

## 🧹 What We Cleaned Up

### 1. File Organization
- Moved all documentation files into a neat `docs/` folder.
- Deleted duplicate files (like the extra `index.html`).
- Removed old diagrams that were cluttering the main folder.

### 2. Code Improvements
- **Fixed Images**: Added code to make sure images load correctly.
- **Better Tests**: Added tests for the Backend and Frontend to catch bugs.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors to make the code more robust.

### 3. Database
- **Real Data**: Replaced fake test data with real service providers from Nanded.
- **Guide**: Created a `DB.md` guide to help others understand the database.

## 🎯 Result
The project is now cleaner, easier to understand, and more stable!
